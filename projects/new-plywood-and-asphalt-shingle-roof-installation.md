title: New Plywood and Asphalt Shingle Roof Installation
date: 2021-08-10T19:37:13.434Z
summary: Asphalt shingles are one of the most common roof types installed by
  homeowners. They are incredibly affordable when comparing different roof
  types. Asphalt roof shingles are lightweight, durable, come in an array of
  colors, and can last up to 20 years. Replacing your current roof with asphalt
  shingles can upgrade your home’s curb appeal, increase real estate value, cut
  down on energy costs, and makes your home safer.
