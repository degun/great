date: 2021-08-10T19:56:51.090Z
summary: >
  There are many advantages to torch down roofing. The first job of any roof
  system is to keep water out of the building/structure, and torch down roofing
  has excellent water-resistant properties. Provided the membrane and insulation
  are installed according to manufacturer application instructions, the flat
  surface of a torch down roof prevents water from collecting and allows it to
  drain off.

Torch down roll roofing is designed for all climates, expanding under heat and contracting under cold conditions without melting or cracking as other materials might. It’s this ability that gives torch down roofs their long lifespan.
