title: Aluminum Gutter Installation
date: 2021-07-17T11:45:13.013Z
summary: "Aluminium  is an incredibly strong, lightweight metal that has proven
  to be a great choice for guttering. It can handle snow and rain without
  rusting. In fact, exposed aluminium wonâ€™t corrode at all with weathering or
  water damage. Instead, it oxidizes and forms a more powerful barrier against
  corrosion. "
