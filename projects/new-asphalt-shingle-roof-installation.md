title: New Asphalt Shingle Roof Installation
date: 2021-08-09T20:04:05.864Z
summary: "Asphalt shingles are one of the most common roof types installed by
  homeowners. They are incredibly affordable when comparing different roof
  types. Asphalt roof shingles are lightweight, durable, come in an array of
  colors, and can last up to 20 years. Some premium asphalt shingle brands boast
  a 50 year lifespan. Replacing your current roof with asphalt shingles can
  upgrade your homeâ€™s curb appeal, increase real estate value, cut down on
  energy costs, and makes your home safer. "
