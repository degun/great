**Important Signs of a Bad Roof Installation**



Roofs are susceptible to wear and tear thanks to their constant exposure to the weather . Unfortunately, when it’s time for repairs, homeowners may find that the installation itself was done poorly within the first place. By knowing the way to identify a poor roofing job you’ll be ready to save yourself from wasted time and money – and therefore the headaches that follow.



A non-uniform appearance

This is something that even the average person can see. If the looks of the roof seems off, there’s an honest chance that the roofing job was done poorly. Look for awkward alignment of materials, bumps and ripples, and mismatched colors and textures. The presence of any of those things may mean that the roofer was poorly trained, inexperienced entirely, or attempting to chop corners.



Stains on the roof

Stains on the roof won't appear until long after the roofer has left. Stains indicate that water is leaking into the roof. Water leakage does not only damage roofing materials. If a roof leak is severe enough, water can seep into the attic and cause mold and damaged insulation. Roof stains don't inherently mean the roof itself was installed poorly, but once stains are identified, homeowners should check other core elements of their roof to make sure the whole installation was not the problem.



Missing or damaged shingles

The most obvious way to spot a bad roof installation is by looking at the shingles. Missing or damaged shingles are common after a serious storm — but if your roof has recently been repaired, this shouldn’t be the case. If your shingles are in bad shape, your roof is at risk for subsequent damages.



No drip edges

Drip edges play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of your roof and your home. They are installed below the shingles and help direct water faraway from the roof and therefore the home’s foundation. Drip edges should be installed to stop damage to the inspiration , basement, and walls.



Using the wrong nails

The improper use of certain nails — or nailing techniques — can make all the difference between a poor roof installation and an excellent one. Overdriven nails can damage shingles and underdriven nails don't secure roofing materials properly. Unfortunately, these aren't the sole common nailing issues. An inexperienced roofer may use nails that rust and improperly locate nails too approximate or too far apart.



How to avoid a bad Roof Installation?

Preventing a nasty roof installation starts with doing all of your research. Now that you simply know what to seem for, you'll help prepare yourself or homeowners you recognize to form better roofing investments.

Here are some tips to make sure the contractor you select with will leave your roof better than they found it.



Request to see certifications/projects

There are a variety of licenses and certifications that roofing contractors should need to prove that they're legitimate. Also ask them to see some of their works or [projects](https://www.thegreatconstruction.com/projects/) that are already done.

Check social media / third party sites

While not an ironclad research method, you'll effectively make a judgment on a roofing company’s quality of labor just by watching their Facebook page. While social media is a great start to look at pictures and read customer reviews — take it a step further. Third party websites such as [Home Advisor,](https://www.homeadvisor.com/rated.TheGreatConstruction.112180048.html) showcase unbiased reviews from real customers.



Go local

When trying to find a roofing contractor, ask your neighbors for suggestions. Local contractors are conversant in area codes and requirements. Moreover, local contractors serve a selected area and work to keep their reputation at a high standard. Many local business owners live in the community!
