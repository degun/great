**What is a Roof made of?**

There are seven basic roofing components you ought to know:

**Shingles:** These are often made from a spread of materials, but their main purpose is to guard underlying sheathing from the weather. Shingles are traditionally measured in squares. A square of shingles is 100 square feet, so if you recognize your roof is 2,500 square feet you'll got to order 25 squares.

**Sheathing:** Boards or sheet material that are attached to the rafters that cover your home. This is also referred to as the deck of a roof.

**Trim:** Installed to guard the seam within the roof along a hip or ridge.

**Rafters**: These are the wood or metal slats inside your home that support the sheathing and shingles. They’re a touch just like the skeleton for your roof.

**Underlayment:** Water-resistant, paper-like material that's laid over plywood sheathing to seal it from damaging elements like rain and snow. This is used with a membrane and vapor barrier, which is usually a sheet of plastic blocking air and water from permeating through.

**Flashing:** sheet or other material installed on top of the joints of a roof system to stop water damage. The joints of your roof are anywhere it changes direction, and flashing is employed to assist seal these points faraway from the weather .

**Drainage**: the planning feature of a roof that permits it to shed water. This is measured using the slope, or pitch, of the roof, which is decided by the increase in inches for every foot of horizontal distance—known because the “run.” For example, a roof with a 5-in-12 slope rises 5 inches for each foot in distance.



**Common Roof Design Elements**

After you understand the components that structure your roof, it’s important to spot roofing design elements, and which of them apply to your home.

1. Gable Wall: These are triangular portions of the house which extend from the eaves to the height of the roof.

2. Centerline of Ridge: Also called the verge, this refers to the wall or rafter under the sting of a roof where a gable ends.

3. Ridge: this is often the very best point of the roof, which is additionally mentioned because the peak.

4. Valley: The areas of the roof where two sections meet and slope down.

5. Eaves: Edges of the roof that hang over the outside walls of a home.

6. Hip: A part where two sections of the roof meet.

7. Abutment: Where sections of the roof meet a vertical area like a wall or chimney.

8. Dormers: Not every roof has them, but these are sections of the house that stick out from the roof, designed to usher in natural light to an attic or third floor.

Take a glance outside and check which elements your roof has, noting what percentage ridges, hips, abutments and gables are present. If you’re considering a roof replacement within the near future, it’s important to know the square footage and style of your existing structure to estimate what proportion it'll cost

What is the best time of year to have your roof replaced?** 



Your roof plays a critical role in helping to stay in your home and everything in it safe from the weather . If you built your house, then you almost certainly have an honest record of the roof installation and a general idea of when the roof may have to be redone. However, if you purchased your house, you would possibly not know the precise history of the roof and when it should get replaced .

So, how will you recognize when it’s time to exchange your roof?



3 Signs Your Roof must get replaced

**Roof “Age Spots”**

Roofs have ways of visibly showing their age. And, although older roofs may still keep the weather out, they'll be more susceptible to damage thanks to wear and tear over the years.

Signs of an aging roof can often be observed from ground level, and sometimes a convenient second-floor window offers a bird’s eye view of the shingles. It’s always best to go away any on-roof inspections to the [professionals.](https://www.thegreatconstruction.com/)



Here are seven indications that your roof could also be past its prime:

Uneven shingles. Asphalt shingles are meant to lie flat with no edges to catch the wind or interfere with water runoff. Cupped shingles with concave centers, wavy surfaces, and ragged or curled shingle edges are all signs that a roof is past its prime.

Bald shingles. The granular coating on asphalt shingles helps to guard them from the weather , like harsh ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. Roof shingles that are losing or have lost their granules are more exposed to UV rays, potentially causing them to age faster and become brittle.

Cracked shingles. Over the years, UV ray exposure from the sun may cause roof shingles to “dry out” and crack on the surface.

Discoloration. The colour of your roofing shingles may fade over the years thanks to UV degradation, another sign of an aging roof.

Dark streaks. While dark streaks on your roof could also be more of an aesthetic problem, they’re a sign of algae growth on your roof. Lichen growth, which occurs with a mixture of algae and fungus, can eventually damage shingles and their protective granules. A homeowner’s initiative should be to possess knowledge, clean and inspect their roof to see the condition of the shingles and see if a repair or reroof is necessary.

Moss. The roots of moss are much larger than those found in lichens. Too much moss on your roof can speed up the loss of granules. Moss also retains water, adding weight, and keeping your roof in constant contact with water. As with shingle discolorations, a roof inspection and cleaning can help determine the health of the shingles beneath the moss.

Time. While properly installed, high-quality asphalt shingles can provide two to 3 decades of protection, constant exposure to the weather eventually takes its toll, and they have to be replaced.  According to I[nterNACHI’s Standard Estimated Life Expectancy Chart for Homes,](https://www.nachi.org/life-expectancy.htm) the life expectancy for architectural asphalt roofing shingles is 30 years and 20 years for three-tab asphalt shingles.

**Roof Storm Damage**



The roof is one among your home’s first lines of defense against Mother Nature. Certain regions of the country are more related to specific adverse weather events, like tornadoes or hurricanes. However, most locales experience occasional summer storms, which may produce damaging wind gusts and hail. Due to its large surface area and exposed location, the roof is especially vulnerable to storm damage.

Hailstorms

A sudden flurry of hailstones can cause immediate damage to shingles, flashing, and gutters. Visible signs of roof hail damage include loss of granules, divots, and cracks. Sometimes roofing shingles will split beneath their surface thanks to a hailstone’s impact, leaving your roof hospitable water infiltration.

Winds

Straight-line winds that proceed a typical storm front can cause an excellent deal of injury during a short amount of your time . These winds travel in one direction, unlike rotating tornadic winds and may reach speeds over 100 miles per hour. The National Severe Storms Laboratory classifies winds over 50-60 miles per hour as damaging.

Shingles that are blown off can leave large areas of your roof completely unprotected from rain or snow. And shingles that remain in situ but are bent or curled beyond their limits may lose their waterproof seal. Wind-driven debris, like tree branches, could crack or pull up shingles, and/or knock granules loose.

If you experience a big hailstorm or other severe weather events, then you'll want to [schedule a roof inspection t](https://www.thegreatconstruction.com/)o see for both visible and hidden damage.



**Roof Leaking Water**

Homeowners may postpone signs of an aging roof and be unaware of storm damage, but water spots typically demand a fast reaction. If your roof has lost its ability to repel water thanks to storm damage or aging, then water damage to the roof deck, insulation, and drywall or mold growth can develop quickly.

Roofs are susceptible to water within the winter, too. When snow thaws and refreezes over the eaves, it can create ice dams. Water that builds abreast of the roof’s surface can copy underneath the shingles, eventually finding even the tiniest of holes and making its way into your home.

How does one spot where the leaks are coming from?

Finding the source of water leaks can be tricky. Water always travels along the trail of least effort , so a little hole near the height of the roof could show up as a water spot within the foyer ceiling. Your first move should be to examine the attic after an important rainfall or while your roof is snow-covered.

* Pay special attention to areas around vents, chimneys and skylights.
* Use a flashlight and look for dark patches on the wood, mold or deteriorated insulation.

Roof Shingles Problems

Is this something that can be repaired? Is this something that requires that a reroof be performed on your home? 

There are a couple of tell-tale signs of shingle problems:

● Loose or missing shingles

● Exposed shingle nail heads

● Asphalt shingles that are drying out, curling, or cracking

● Dark patches on your roof

● Shingle granules in your gutters or on the bottom around your house

● New water leaks in your home

● Higher heating and cooling expenses



Loose or Missing Shingles

If quite one shingle is loose or actually missing, that would be a symbol of a general shingle problem. Maybe it had been caused by extreme weather, but your shingles also could be improperly installed or getting too old. Either way, your attic and other interior areas could be vulnerable to water damage.



Exposed Nails

Asphalt shingles are installed using metal nails. If weather or age has pulled some nails partially out of the roof, which will cause small cracks or holes where water can get through, causing rot or other damage to your roof.



Drying, Curling, or Cracking Shingles

Drying asphalt shingles can curl or crack. These are signs that they're a minimum of on the brink of the top of their lives and not getting to keep water out of your home for for much longer .



Dark Roof Patches

Areas of your roof that suddenly look darker can mean two things. First, the protective surface granules from the shingles might slump , leaving the dark asphalt under them exposed. Or second, the dark areas could be moss or algae, which should be cleaned.



 Falling Shingle Granules

Look in your gutters and on the bottom around your house. If you discover small granules like fine gravel, they might slump on your asphalt shingles as they age. That can leave your shingles more exposed to sun, snow, and hail, and may expose your home to water damage.

Leaks

If new leaks develop in your attic or other parts of your home during rain, snow, or hail, you'll be missing shingles or have several that are significantly damaged. Leaks can cause mold and other serious problems.



Higher Heating and Cooling Expenses

4.How to stop roofing tiles from clogging your gutter.



 It’s a problem faced by both residential and commercial property owners. And it’s not something you should put up with.

Clogged gutters can lead to overflowing water, leaks and damage to the inside and outside of your property. They can even contribute to ice dam formation in winter.

Ways to prevent clogged gutters becoming a drag for you.

Keep trees trimmed

Trees are an excellent feature around your property, but they’re not so advantageous for gutters. Trees that stretch over, or grow within close proximity of your roof, can release tons of leaves and twigs, especially in autumn. When they’re released, they fall or blow into your gutters and make it harder for water to flow through. The problem becomes worse as leaves become wet and make a dense barrier.



Install leaf guards

Of course, there is a way to stop those leaves getting into your gutters. Leaf guards filter leaves and other debris before they enter your gutters, allowing water to flow through. It’s worth getting expert advice before installing leaf guards though. Some types are less effective, retaining debris and allowing moss to grow around your gutters.



Have gutters cleaned professionally

Keeping your gutters clear yourself isn’t easy, neither is it something advisable without the proper health and safety training. Professional gutter clearing allows you to keep on top of your guttering without any hassle or stress. For both commercial and residential properties, this is a sure-fire way to stop your gutters clogging and causing more expensive problems.

Regular inspections

Damage to gutters can increase the likelihood of clogging. Even the littlest crack can act as a trap for debris, allowing it to create up. The solution? Have your gutters inspected, to make sure they're fully working order. This will identify any issues and allow them to be fixed before they develop into something more serious. It will also flag up any issues together with your roof, like loose tiles, that would damage your gutters.



Install better gutters

Even with preventative measures, you might find your gutters are still clogging regularly. The problem could simply be how your gutters are installed. Poorly installed gutters make clogging more likely, accelerating debris build-up in certain areas. Consider having a new guttering system installed. The investment could pay off within the end of the day , saving you money on continual repairs.
