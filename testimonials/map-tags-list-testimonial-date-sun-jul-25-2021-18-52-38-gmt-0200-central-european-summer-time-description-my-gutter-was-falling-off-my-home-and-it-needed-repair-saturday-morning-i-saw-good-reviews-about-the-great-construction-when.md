description: My gutter was falling off my home and it needed repair. Saturday
  morning I saw good reviews about the Great Construction. When I called early
  Saturday morning Denis answered and said he would come down in the afternoon.
  He texted me that he was on his way and he was even early. Denis and Ben
  repaired my gutter for a fair price and also fixed a piece of my roofing that
  had come off from the wind. I would definitely recommend them. A job well
  done! Thank you!
