description: This company did an excellent job on my attic chimney repairs. They
  repaired the bricks stabilized the chimney with support beams and finished the
  concrete casing. Ben and Dennis were very professional, kind, answered all my
  questions and very helpful explaining the work they were doing. the job was
  done exactly as they said it would be and it looked great when completed. they
  cleaned up and left the home as they found it. I would highly recommend them
  for their quality work!
