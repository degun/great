**Customer Gutter NJ Reviews**

"My gutter was falling off my home and it needed repair. Saturday morning I saw good reviews about the Great Construction. When I called early Saturday morning Denis answered and said he would come down in the afternoon. He texted me that he was on his way and he was even early. Denis and Ben repaired my gutter for a fair price and also fixed a piece of my roofing that had come off from the wind. I would definitely recommend them. A job well done! Thank you!" -Valerie D.
