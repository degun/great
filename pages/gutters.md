**Gutters** have one primary function. That is to divert rainwater away from the foundation and basement of your house. A good gutter system ensures that your home is protected from erosion and basement flooding.

It also protects the landscaping that you have around your home. In addition, an effectively-designed gutter system prevents the growth of mildew and mold. Plus, it helps you maintain the curb appeal of your home by mitigating paint damage and preventing stains from its exteriors.

Living in New Jersey means experiencing damaging ice dams in your downspouts and gutters, most especially if you fail to have your gutters regularly cleaned. So, when was the last time you had yours checked?

With **The Great Construction Company**, you can be assured that we can help you design and maintain your gutters.

### Types of Gutters

There are basically two types of gutters, seamed and seamless.

**Seamed/sectional gutters**

These are gutters that you can purchase in pieces or sections. They are then patched or assembled using an adhesive or a snap system or both to make a gutter system. Usually, this type of gutter system comes in lengths of ten feet to twenty feet.

This gutter system is easy-to-install and costs much less than the other system. However, they may not last as long, eventually leaking in a much shorter time.

**Seamless gutters**

This kind of gutter does not require fasteners or joints. It is made from just one piece of material and will run the whole length of your house. However, this means that the material has to be professionally cut to a precise length.

The absence of seams ensures that leaks rarely occur. This also means a lesser amount of dirt and debris in the gutter, which in turn means lesser maintenance and upkeep costs.

Seamless gutters are almost maintenance-free, especially when protected with gutter guards. They are also longer-lasting. What’s more, they add to the aesthetic value and curb appeal of your home.

You can call on our gutter specialists for expert advice on what type of gutter system is best for your home.

### Gutter Styles

Three gutter styles are commonly found in most homes and buildings. These are:

**K-style gutters**

K-style gutters are the most popular style today. They are quick and easy to install and are very durable. They curve out at the bottom, thus, resembling a crown molding. Their cross-section looks like the letter “K”, hence the name.

**Fascia gutters**

This type of gutter is directly installed on the fascia board. They are larger than the other gutter styles, which make them compatible with larger roofs. They are perfect for areas with extreme weather and can hold up to severe storms and winds.

**Half-round gutters**

These are U-shaped gutters commonly used to give a historical appeal to your home or building. They have more complicated designs and can increase its curb appeal.

### Gutter Materials

We at **The Great Construction and Chimney** use quality gutter materials and products from our partner manufacturers and suppliers. These are covered by warranties to ensure that materials standards are met.

**Copper gutters**

Copper is the favorite and commonly-used material, more so if you choose a seamless gutter system. They are corrosion-resistant, sturdy, and of high-quality. The extreme strength of copper gutters allows them to withstand falling debris, heavy and freezing rain, sleet, and snow.

Why choose copper gutters? They are :

* Strong and sturdy
* Durable and long-lasting
* Aesthetically-pleasing
* Corrosion-resistant (does not rust easily)

**Aluminum gutters**

Aluminum is the strongest material for gutters in the market. Aluminum gutters are less susceptible to damage, especially in cold weather. This type of gutter also is fully weather- and rust-proof.

Plus, you can paint over your aluminum gutters. So, matching your gutter system to your home’s design is easy.

**Wood gutters**

Wood gutters, though considered as an older type, are strong and look beautiful in your homes. They especially complement the historic value of your home and are great for restoration works.

**Vinyl gutters**

Vinyl gutters are commonly used in today’s homes. They are also lightweight and cost the least compared to the other materials. Many sectional gutters in the market are made from vinyl. Thus, it has become a favorite among DIYers.

This type of gutters, however, does not last as long as those made from aluminum or copper. They eventually become brittle over time.

**Gutter guards**

Gutter guards prevent clogging in your gutter system. They keep dirt and debris out. Thus, they reduce the need to clean your gutters.

We at **The Great Construction Company** install and replace the following types of gutter guards:
