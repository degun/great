Choosing the type of **flat roofing** system for a structure, whether it’s for your house or building can be quite overwhelming. There are so many things to consider, like the type and material used, and which contractor to hire.

At **The Great Construction Company**, you are guaranteed to have quality built flat roofs and professional contractors that will be with you every step of the way.

### What is Flat Roofing?

**Flat roofs** have become one of the most popular roofing options for both commercial and residential use. It is a type of **roofing** solution wherein the surface of the roof has a very low slope. This can be around ¼ to ½ of an inch per foot.

In the past, **flat roofs** were only used for industrial and commercial purposes. Because of this, there have been many misconceptions about it. Some say they are more expensive to install and prone to leaks. However, these are all wrong.

The truth is that having a **flat roofing** system can give you more flexibility than any other type of roofing solution. If you want, you can be creative. It can even be an additional living space that you can use.

In fact, if the **flat roof** is well maintained, it is quite an effective roofing system that will fit anyone’s budget. Furthermore, with its slight slope, it is quite easy to do a visual inspection to check if there are any issues that need to be fixed. 

### What are the Materials We Use?

We at the First Rate Roofing and Chimney use only top quality materials for your flat roofing system. We can also install any flat-roofing material of your choice. So, don’t hesitate to contact us for a free quote.

**TPO**

One of the more popular flat roof types, TPO or also known as Thermoplastic Polyolefin is a mix of both ethylene-propylene and polypropylene rubber. It is one of the **best flat roof** materials to use.

It is an affordable option that can last you at ten to twenty years. Additionally, it requires little to no maintenance as well.

**PVC Membrane**

PVC is one of the favorites to use for our flat-roofing projects. It may be more pricey than your standard single-ply roofing material. Nevertheless, it has a lot of benefits for its price. PVC has a reinforced membrane which makes it resistant to cracking and damage from impact. These are usually the reasons why a flat roof’s lifespan significantly shortens. Another thing that is great about PVC is that it does not need a lot of maintenance and will actually last as long as twenty years.

Furthermore, we at **The Great Construction Company** offers a warranty for a newly-installed PVC Roofing.

**EPDM Rubber**

EPDM or Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer is a synthetic rubber. It is commonly used for **industrial flat roofing** solutions. Many choose this material for their flat roof mainly because of its affordability. It is also one of the main reasons why it is as popular as using PVC.

Although EPDM may not be as durable as PVC, it is extremely water-resistant. Plus, its weathering and temperature characteristics are great.
