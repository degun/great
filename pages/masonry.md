Customer Siding NJ Reviews

We are beyond impressed with the professionalism and workmanship of The Great Construction Company.  From our initial call for an estimate, to project completion, they have consistently demonstrated why they have the right experience. Our project involved the placement of new stonework alongside 11 year old stonework and it couldn't have been more beautifully done.  Denis and his team took their time, carefully selecting the stones, their placement, and the mortar to match the existing stonework.  They were here when they said they were going to be here and they cleaned up when they were done.  That is a rarity these days.  If you want to ensure that your project receives the time and attention it deserves, look no further that The Great Construction Company. You won't be disappointed! -Jonh B.

Denis and Ben were very communicative and cooperative. Their crew worked diligently to complete our lakefront stone retaining wall and connecting pavers sidewalk in a timely and efficient manner. The price was reasonable, and we are extremely pleased with the end result. Highly recommend them! -Linda C.

The Great Construction Company was first recommended to us by one of my friends.  Denis expertly completed the stacked stone work in those two rooms, and has since built our grill center by the pool house, as well as done all maintenance and construction of additional brick and limestone landscape walls surrounding our modern home. 

Denis and Ben team experience, craftsmanship, trustworthiness and reliability set them and their crew apart, making The Great Construction an excellent choice for any type of masonry job you may have.  Highly recommended! -Susan h.
