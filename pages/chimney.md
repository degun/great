**Schedule a Chimney Cleaning & Inspection** 

You may need to get a chimney sweeping for the flues connected to your furnace/ hot water heater if you have not already.  Both oil and gas fired appliances must be cleaned or inspected annually.  Beat the rush and start thinking about scheduling your cleaning for your fireplace, wood stove, gas or wood fireplace inserts, service your gas log set and clean the flue that connects to your gas or oil heating appliance.



  



The Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) recommends all homeowners have an annual chimney cleaning and inspection by a certified chimney sweep? Contact The Great Construction and make sure your home is safe.  Call us for a free estimate +1 (201) 673-5638.
