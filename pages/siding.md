**The importance of siding**

The primary purpose of siding is to protect your home from rain, heat, snow, wind and heavy storms. Siding also acts as insulation for your home by keeping the heat inside and cold outside.
Investing in siding can add curb appeal to your home and make it look new again.
Proper siding installation is the best way to ensure that your siding provides your home with long-lasting protection. The Great Construction Company delivers quality craftsmanship on every siding project.

**Get the look you want!**

When you get a new siding for your home or commercial structure, it gives it a new look. Thus, your home’s aesthetic value is increased. However, did you know that the right siding can also improve the energy efficiency and strength of your home? 
Our company does not only use siding materials that look good but also aim to increase your home’s functionality as well. 
Vinyl is one of the most popular types of sidings that we have installed over the years. The main reason why most people choose vinyl is because of its affordability. Not only that, but it is also quite durable and can withstand extreme temperatures. Another thing that is great about this material is that it does not easily warp and is water-resistant.
What’s more, our company only uses the best type of vinyl siding. In addition, there are also a variety of styles that you can choose from.
Ultimately, it’s your home, and you should be able to take pride in its exterior. We’ll listen to suggestions and find a way to meet your siding needs.

**Customer Siding NJ Reviews**

“The 2 young men came and looked over my repair issue. They explained what they would do. They quoted me a price which we agreed on. They immediately went to work on the repair. I didn't have to wait for another day for them to come back. The total repair took about a half hour to complete. They climbed the roof and put the flashing (trim) back on to the peak of my house. Job well done. Also a worry I dont have anymore. Yes, I would hire them again. Thanks Dennis and Ben.” -Terry S.

“I found Blendi and Denis through a friend of mine that they had done a job with before. I hired them because I had a siding repair and their price was the best. I am very happy that I had them repair this for me. They were prompt, they kept masks the whole time and respected the social distance terms. They did a great job, finished when they said they would and the place was very clean after. I would definitely suggest and call them again.” -Brian P.
