### Materials That We Use

When you get a new siding for your home or commercial structure, it gives it a new look. Thus, your home’s aesthetic value is increased. However, did you know that the right siding can also improve the energy efficiency and strength of your home?

Our company does not only use materials that look good but also aim to increase your home’s functionality as well. So here are the materials that we use.

**Vinyl**

Vinyl is one of the most popular types of **sidings** that we have installed over the years. The main reason why most people choose vinyl is because of its affordability. Not only that, but it is also quite durable and can withstand extreme temperatures. Another thing that is great about this material is that it does not easily warp and is water-resistant.

What’s more, our company only uses the best type of vinyl siding. In addition, there are also a variety of styles that you can choose from.

**Fiber Cement**

For those who put durability as the main requirement, then Fiber Cement is your best choice. Not only is this siding material sustainable but it is also durable and long-lasting.

Fiber cement is made of wood fiber and cement. Plus, it does not have any artificial additives which make it eco-friendly. Although it may be more expensive than vinyl, fiber cement sidings can last you more than 50 years which is a great deal.

So work with us. We at **The Great Construction Company** can guarantee only use the best fiber cement sidings. Furthermore, we have a variety of siding styles for you to choose from.

**Stucco**

We also offer Stucco sidings. This is a type of siding that does not only look good but is highly efficient as well. Stucco is known to be a good insulator for both cool and warm air which can reduce your electricity costs. Additionally, it is easy to maintain.

For those who love a smooth and clean finish, stucco sidings are your best bet. Our siding experts make sure that it is installed properly and cleanly. It is one of the most affordable siding options we have. With 25 years of experience, our professionals have made this their craft. Once you see the finished product, you will certainly be satisfied.

**Wood**

One of the more eco-friendly materials around, it is definitely the most popular choice by most homeowners. Wood is the most versatile siding option out of all other types out there. It is easy to design it for your preferences. In addition, there are a lot of wood options that you can choose from.

As a siding, wood is quite easy to repair and does not need a lot of effort. However, if issues still persist, don’t hesitate to contact professionals like us at **The Great Construction Company**. We will make that all your siding issues will be resolved quickly.

**Thermally Modified Wood**

Ordinary wood siding has been notoriously known for being prone to termite infestation and rotting if not coated and prepped properly. However, with Thermally Modified Wood, you won’t have to worry about that. This type of wood has been subjected to pyrolysis or heating without the presence of oxygen. This process removes all moisture.

Thermally modified wood sidings last longer than ordinary raw wood. Also, they do not need a lot of maintenance.

**Engineered Wood**

If you want a **siding** that looks closest to real wood, then engineered wood is your best option. It is composed of mainly wood and a few more materials which makes the final product more natural-looking.

**Brick and Stone**

If durability is your main concern, then it is best to go with stone or **brick siding**. It does not only last longer than any other siding but it also increases your curb appeal. These types of siding can last long even with fluctuating and extreme temperatures.

They also require little to no maintenance at all. We have plenty of stone and brick styles that you can choose from. Our company can guarantee that all the materials used and services rendered are of the highest quality.

**Metal**

Choosing to go with metal sidings gives your home or structure a more industrial feel. It has plenty of style and color options that can definitely suit your preferences. Furthermore, metal sidings give your building optimum protection from pests, moisture, and unpredictable weather.

A steel siding can last for more than 25 years. And with proper maintenance, it can last even longer.
